## Api Providers

An 'Api Provider' is expected to be used as an end-point for one or more calculations within a walk. These could vary from a web-based API to even an Excel spreadsheet.

Furthermore, it is expected that any provider will be able to provide instances of `IApiRequestor` as defined by the `Core` project.
